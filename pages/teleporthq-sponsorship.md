# teleportHQ<br/>Sponsors JSPM

<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -4em; margin-bottom: 4em; font-size: 0.9em;"><em>Guy Bedford, March 15<sup style="padding-left:0.15em">th</sup> 2022</em></p>

_Collaborative low code in-browser development platform [teleportHQ](https://teleporthq.io) is now an official sponsor of the JSPM CDN._

A massive thank you to teleportHQ for their sponsorship of the JSPM project and CDN, which will significantly aid the sustainability of the project.

Running the [JSPM Generator](https://github.com/jspm/generator) in the browser with [ES Module Shims](https://github.com/guybedford/es-module-shims) allows teleportHQ to support arbitrary in-browser dynamic npm package loading without complex build tooling due to the simplicity of import maps and the performance and compatibility work handled by the JSPM ES Module CDN.

<p>&ldquo;At teleportHQ, we are creating a unified building experience for front-end teams. Developers, designers, marketers, project/product managers and business owners can collaborate and directly contribute to the building process, in real-time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our goal is to reduce the effort of buiding front-end apps by more than 50% compared to the current process. In order to achieve this goal, we need to create a 100% browser-based experience which is at least as performant as locally installed tools. JSPM has been instrumental in helping us achieving this goal.&rdquo;</p>

teleportHQ decided to sponsor JSPM as an investment in ES Module CDN workflows:

<div style="background-color: #f1f5f7; padding: 0.5em 1.5em; margin: 2em 0em; font-style: italic">
<p>&ldquo;As we've been prototyping JSPM, we've found that the dynamic in-browser workflows made possible by the generator directly improve the development experience for our users: a teleportHQ app using JSPM ES Module CDN cold-boots in less than 5 seconds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sponsoring JSPM allows us to put financial investment behind our technical investment to ensure the project will continue to be a sustainable foundation for us to build on.&rdquo;</p>
