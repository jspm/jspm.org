# JSPM CLI - Import Map Package Management

<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -4em; margin-bottom: 4em; font-size: 0.9em;"><em>Guy Bedford, April 4<sup style="padding-left:0.15em">th</sup> 2023</em></p>

Last week Apple landed support for import maps in Safari 16.4, resulting in all major web browsers now [fully supporting](https://caniuse.com/import-maps) the new [import maps standard](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps).

Today, the JSPM CLI is being relaunched as an import map package management tool.

### CacheFly Sponsorship

The `jspm.io` CDN is now running on the CacheFly CDN, thanks to their generous sponsorship. With over 900m requests being served per month, the migration to their CDN service was seamless and has reduced our infrastructure costs significantly.

Thanks as well to our many sponsors who have continued to support the project as it grows into the next decade.
